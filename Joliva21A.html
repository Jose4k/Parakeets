            Why are some parakeets <span class = "blue">blue </span>and others <span class = "green">green</span>?
        </h1>
        <h2><span class = "blue">Blue </span>parakeets are mutants! </h2>
        <p>  For pet parakeets, <span class = "blue">blue </span> is a very common color. This color is a mutation caused by the absence of <span class = "yellow">yellow </span> coloration from the original <span class = "green">green</span>. 
            While <span class = "blue">blue </span>is a safe color for pet birds, a <span class = "blue">blue </span> parakeet would be easily spotted by predators and have a survival disadvantage in the wild.
        </p>
        <br>
       <h2><span class = "green">Green </span>is protective camouflage</h2>
        <p>In nature, parakeetsâ€™ primary color is <span class = "green">green </span> with a secondary <span class = "black">black</span> wave pattern. This lets them hide better among tree leaves and grass.</p>
